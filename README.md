# First Back-end app

This is the first back-end app form MITxPRO's Full Stack Development program. This simple application uses node.js with express, lowdb, superagent  and faker (for fake data). The idea behind this application was to understand the basics of creating a Three Tiered Application. 

I went through every single step which included:

1) Creation of the server using <b>Express</b>.
2) Creation of a simple database with <b>lowdb</b>.
3) Execution of HTTP GET and POST requests using <b>Superagent</b>.
4) Usage of the package <b>FakerJS</b> to generate fake user data that would be stored into the database.
5) Implementation of a very simple UI using the CSS framework <b>Bootstrap</b>.

Once the application was concluded, the app was deployed in the cloud, for this application I used <b>Heroku</b> as my cloud service.
